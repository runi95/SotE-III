/*
    A note about compiletime, runtime and macros:

    Ceres is able to execute arbitrary Lua code during the map compilation stage.
    This can be used to write source-injecting macros and modify object data of the
    currently compiling map, amongst other things.

    This is called compiletime.

    There are two ways to execute code at compiletime:
        * by putting it inside `build.lua`,
        * by using macros.

    Declarations that are only available during compiletime are marked @compiletime.
    Declarations that are macros are marked @macro.
    Declarations that are only available to the map itself when running inside WC3 are marked @runtime.
